### What is CRUD?

<p> CRUD is an acronym for the four basic operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete. Most applications have some kind of CRUD functionality, and we can assume that every programmer had to deal with CRUD at some point. A CRUD application is one that uses forms to get data into and out of a database. </p>
